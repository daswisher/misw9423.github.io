Wearables are the reason why soft circuits are prevalent in modern culture. Soft circuits are electronics that are embedded into fabric. How do you Arduino clothes though? It's the reason why the LilyPad arduino was invented. By using SMDs and conductive thread to connect the components, it makes it easy to totally geek out your clothes. Don't believe me? You must have at least seen one of these at a concert.
