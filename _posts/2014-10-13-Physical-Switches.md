Switches are simple components that are used to control the flow of electricity by toggling or diverting flow. Poles and throws are attributes of switches that can be used to describe how many circuits it is connected to (poles), and the number of positons are available per pole (throws). An example of a single pole single throw (SPST) switch, it would be connected to a single circuit and would connect or break (create an open) within the circuit. A SPDT (single pole double throw) would be a switch that controls where the power flows (i.e. to the rest of the circuit or divert to ground). There are a couple different categories that switches fall into which are maintained and momentary. Maintained switches keep their state and only change when they're toggled (like a light switch). Momentary switches only keep their state as long as the interaction occurs; Their state reverts as soon as the interaction is over (i.e. a button). Momentary switches can be found as either normally open (NO) or normally closed (NC) which refers to their default state before interaction. I'll go through a quick list of different switches:

<table>
	<tr>
		<td>Name</td>
		<td>Momentary? (Yes/No)</td>
		<td>Description and/or Example</td>
	</tr>

	<tr>
		<td>Tactile Button</td>
		<td>Y</td>
		<td>Buttons that give tactile feedback like keys on a keyboard.</td>
	</tr>

	<tr>
		<td>Latching Buttons</td>
		<td>N</td>
		<td>Power button found on a computer.</td>
	</tr>

	<tr>
		<td>Toggle Switches</td>
		<td>N</td>
		<td>Switches that are operated by a lever. This would be a light switch or the switch found on most powerstrips.</td>
	</tr>

	<tr>
		<td>Slide Switches</td>
		<td>N</td>
		<td>Power switch found on cd players or Walkman players.</td>
	</tr>

	<tr>
		<td>Microswitches</td>
		<td>Y</td>
		<td>Triggered by movement.</td>
	</tr>
	
	<tr>
		<td>Tilt Switches</td>
		<td>N</td>
		<td>Toggle state based upon orientation. There is a ball inside that will connect the internal contacts if it is in the correct position. There are also multiaxis switches.</td>
	</tr>
</table>

There are ways to replicate the same concept behind switches using other materials. One property to consider when creating a switch is whether or not the materials are conductive. What makes a conductor is if it charged particles can move freely through the subject. For example, water by itself is not conductive. As soon as salt is introduced to water, it becomes conductive since the salt is an electrolyte. DIY switches are usually found in two forms: contact switches or bridge switches. Contact switches are when the user has to fold or pinch the surface to make the contacts connect. Bridge switches are when there needs to be a conductive material the connects the contacts. Here are some examples I can think of: 
1. Putting contacts at the finger tips of gloves, and completing the circuit when the thumb touches the pointer finger.
2. Having a shirt where if someone pinches a spot on the shirt, it lights up. (I.e. shirt that says, "Pinch me, I'm Irish.")
