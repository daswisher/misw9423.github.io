Switches are simple components that are used to control the flow of electricity by toggling or diverting flow. Poles and throws are attributes of switches that can be used to describe how many circuits it is connected to (poles), and the number of positons are available per pole (throws). An example of a single pole single throw (SPST) switch, it would be connected to a single circuit and would connect or break (create an open) within the circuit. A SPDT (single pole double throw) would be a switch that controls where the power flows (i.e. to the rest of the circuit or divert to ground). There are a couple different categories that switches fall into which are maintained and momentary. Maintained switches keep their state and only change when they're toggled (like a light switch). Momentary switches only keep their state as long as the interaction occurs; Their state reverts as soon as the interaction is over (i.e. a button). Momentary switches can be found as either normally open (NO) or normally closed (NC) which refers to their default state before interaction. I'll go through a quick list of different switches:

<table>
	<tr>
		<td>Name</td>
		<td>Momentary? (Yes/No)</td>
		<td>Description and/or Example</td>
	</tr>

	<tr>
		<td>Tactile Button</td>
		<td>Y</td>
		<td>Buttons that give tactile feedback like keys on a keyboard.</td>
	</tr>

	<tr>
		<td>Latching Buttons</td>
		<td>N</td>
		<td>Power button found on a computer.</td>
	</tr>

	<tr>
		<td>Toggle Switches</td>
		<td>N</td>
		<td>Switches that are operated by a lever. This would be a light switch or the switch found on most powerstrips.</td>
	</tr>

	<tr>
		<td>Slide Switches</td>
		<td>N</td>
		<td>Power switch found on cd players or Walkman players.</td>
	</tr>

	<tr>
		<td>Microswitches</td>
		<td>Y</td>
		<td>Triggered by movement.</td>
	</tr>
	
	<tr>
		<td>Tilt Switches</td>
		<td>N</td>
		<td>Toggle state based upon orientation. There is a ball inside that will connect the internal contacts if it is in the correct position. There are also multiaxis switches.</td>
	</tr>
</table>
