Project enclosures are more than just a case to keep everything inside. Enclosures can and should be utilized to further enhance a project. Whether it's an audio project or just a simple button and light, enclosures can serve as a purely astehtic medium, or as a functional purpose that serves as a ground for all internal electronics. If enclosures were not as important as the internals the contain, would <a href="http://www.robosaurus.com/">Robosaurus</a> be as ferocious as a regular construction crane? Personally, I believe that aesthetics should always be at the forefront in a product. Design always tells a story. Growing up, kids always hear, "Don't judge a book by its cover." Naturally, NOBODY LISTENS TO THAT. Size, shape, texture, and color can influence how people interact with products and how they the product is preceived. For example, people will care for a car that appears to be brand new differently from a car that has worn paint, rust, missing bumpers, and dents even though the cars are the exact same model. That person might drive the first car with extreme caution and park in the far back of the parking lot away from everybody, but the minute they get in the second car are a little more willing to eat and drink in the car and might not care if they hit a wall in a parking garage.
