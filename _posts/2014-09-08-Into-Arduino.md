When working with Arduino, it's important to understand some of the outputs/inputs on the Arduino board as well as fundamental properties of electricity. To start, since we're using an Arduino Uno R3, it has the following pins:

	1xIOREF
	1xReset
	1x3.3 V
	1x5 V
	2xGround
	1xVin
	6xAnalog Inputs
	14xDigital (6 are PWM)
