There are a number of things that can be done to diversify the interaction between a button and an led. Sure there are only two pieces of hardware, but with Aruino, the software potential used to interface the two is virtually limitless.

Here are three low level things that can be done to change the interaction between an LED and a button:
	1. Toggle the LED on and off
	2. Hold the button to keep the LED on
	3. Each button press increases the brightness of the LED

At a higher level, there are a number of things that emulate the interaction between a button (or a switch), and some sort of light. Here is a quick list of things I can think of:
	Crosswalk button at stop lights
	Turning signal on cars
	Light switch on oven
	These crazy things

Can you think of more?
