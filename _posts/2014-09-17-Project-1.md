The idea behind this first project is to create a simple LED garden. The concept is to embed a handful of LEDs with plants so that the LEDs are visible. As a person approaches the garden, the garden will light up and get progressively brighter the closer they get. By using a simple sonar shield, the system will be able to detect an object at up to 11 feet. Some additional features to this system will provide information to the gardener about the health of the plants by gathering data on temperature, light exposure, and moisture levels in the soil.

After peer review, I have decided to limit the features of the project as well as change the interaction of light. To make the project simpler, I will be removing the information about garden health. In regards to how the garden lights, instead of doing just simple lights, I will have the LEDs emulate the behavior as fireflys. The closer a person gets to the garden, more fireflys will "appear."


Materials List:
Soldering iron
Solder
Wire strippers 
22 AWG wire (two different colors)
5mm LEDs
Arduino
9v battery
9v connector
Electrical tape (or insulation and a lighter)
Plants
Planting Pot

Alternative to using live plants:
Foam
Fake plants
Material to cover foam such as dirt of fake moss

Since I'm using 12 LEDs and the fireflys require pulse width modulation (PWM) to control fade sequences, I'm going to need to use <a href="http://misw9423.github.io/jekyll/update/2014/09/17/Charlieplexing.html">Charlieplexing</a> in order to overcome the ratio of outputs to output sources.
