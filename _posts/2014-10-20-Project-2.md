The Heinekamp is meant to be a simple way to start a party. As opposed to project 1, project 2 is entirely meant to be a hardware-only implementation of interactive electronics. For the sake of ease in regards to deadlines, this project is basically an amp and speaker housed within a mini keg. The goal is to provide a medium for people who want to play an instrument alongside their favorite music. By providing a dual input interface of a 1/4" jack and a 3.5mm jack, this would allow for simultaneous connection of a guitar and an mp3 player where both can play at the same time through the same speakers. Some underlying problems that are expected is that since this is an audio based project, there's most likely specialized components that need to be used to account for the analog wave forms of sound. Here is a basic list of components required for the project:

<table>
	<tr>1 Heineken mini-keg</tr>
	<tr>2 lm386 IC audio amps</tr>
	<tr>1 3.5mm input jack</tr>
	<tr>1 1/4" input jack</tr>
	<tr>Soldering iron</tr>
	<tr>Solder</tr>
	<tr>Capacitors</tr>
	<tr>2 Logarithmic turn pots</tr>
	<tr>22 AWG wire of assorted color</tr>
</table>
