Something that I've always wanted to do since I was a kid is to build my own drone. For this project, I'm going to be building the basic proof of concept for the manual controls in a drone. Drones are things that are able to function autonomously. The drone I'm making is supposed to be an aircraft which is why I'm developing manual controls so I can override the program during flight if intervention is needed. Some of the controls for this project will be for a single motor, one servo, and an LED. The purpose is to prove individual control of analog and digital values over wireless networked devices (using Xbee).
