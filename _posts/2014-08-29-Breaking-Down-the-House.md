Today, I was tasked with breaking apart something electronic in my house. Luckily, I already have the wall in my office area decorated with a dismantled laptop :D
Needless to say, let's get into it!
While there are a bunch of parts to look at, I unfortunately had to throw away some components since there was no way to hang a heavy @#$ battery on the wall. To begin, we can see in this first image that we have the motherboard, a usb controller card, a keyboard, hard drive controller cards (HDD platter+head), the webcam, speakers, wireless modules, and the microphone. {If you want to get technical, yes thats a portion of the LCD panel at the top of the image}.

Looking a little closer at the motherboard, we can see our components a little better. Thanks to the many advancements in technology, it's not incredibly easy to see a specific individual part immediately and be able to replace it. Bear with me here. So some of the major parts you'll find connected on this board are the processor and graphic processor (CPU and GPU) located under the copper heatsink, a couple sticks of memory (RAM), the black hard drive (HDD) serial ATA (SATA) port, an ethernet port (RJ45), audio connectors (3.5 mm audio jacks), and the external display connector (VGA).
