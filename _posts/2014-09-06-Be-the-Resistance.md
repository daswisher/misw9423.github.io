Resistors are crucial to circuitry by allowing for control of power to components. Remembering <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ohm%27s_law">Ohm's law</a>, we can remember that voltage is found by multiplying current by resistance. There are a couple different composition types which would be carbon or metal. From there, there are different techniques to achieve resistance. With carbon, it is usually produced as a film and wrapped into a cylinder to create an axial resistor (where the cylinder is inline with the wire) for use in THT implementations. Thick film is used in contrast to thin film axials for use in SMD application. The difference between thin and thick is the manufacturing process as well as the compositions. Thin film is produced by using vacuum deposition onto a substrate where as thick film is created by stencil printing onto a screen. On the other end are metal implementations which are typically better than carbon. Metal film resistors are also produced using sputtering with nickel chromium. The reason why metal film is better than carbon is its stability over time, higher temperature tolerance, and lower noise. The only disadvantage to using metal film is that it is more expensive than carbon film. If temperature is an issue, there are metal-oxide film resistors that have a higher heat tolerance than standard metal or carbon thin-film. Along with film, there are also metal coil resistors where resistance is created by the thinness of the wire as well as the number windings. The issue with wire wound is that it generates electromagnetic inductance, resulting in a possibility of higher amounts of electric noise generated. 
With axial resistors, the resistance value can be determined by the color bands that are printed on the resistor. There are normally four color bands where the first three color bands determine the value, and the fourth band determines the tolerance value. Here is a quick table that can be used to determine the value of a resistor.
