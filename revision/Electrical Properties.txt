When working with Arduino, it's important to understand some of the outputs/inputs on the Arduino board as well as fundamental properties of electricity. To start, since we're using an Arduino Uno R3, it has the following pins:

	1xIOREF
	1xReset
	1x3.3 V
	1x5 V
	2xGround
	1xVin
	6xAnalog Inputs
	14xDigital (6 are PWM)

In regards to electricity, components have design specifications that results in a maximum tolerance for particular properties of electricity (i.e voltage or amperage). Fortunately, voltage (v), resistance (r), and amps (i) are all related by Ohm's law giving a formula of v=ir. Another important property to consider is wattage (p), which is found with the formula p=iv. When attempting to determine whether or not a component is suitable for a particular circuit, it's necessary to verify the component's ratings, and adjust the circuit design accordingly.

There are two types of circuits: series circuits and parallel circuits. A series circuit is one where there is only one path that the power flows through. Parallel circuits have multiple paths for electricity to flow.
